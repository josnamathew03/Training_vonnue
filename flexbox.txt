flexbox is used to make css layouts more easier
control position, size, spacing of elements relative to their parent elements and each other
work reponsively
apply display type as flex and all the children before flexible
    display: flex;
by defaukt flex items stack from left to right

You use it when you want:
A navigation bar
A card layout
Buttons or boxes to resize and align nicely across screen sizes

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

FLEX GROW PROPERTY

allow to grow elemnts in to the available space but the rate at which it grow is governed by flex groe property
If all children have flex-grow: 0, they won't grow at all ‚Äî they'll just take up their natural space.
If you set flex-grow: 1 for each child, they will share the remaining space equally.
If one child has flex-grow: 2 and another has flex-grow: 1, the first one will get twice as much of the leftover space as the second.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FLEX SHRINK

rate at which elemnts shrink
Imagine you and your friends are sitting on a bench (the flex container). But the bench is not big enough for everyone to sit comfortably. So, you all scoot closer (shrink) to make space.
flex-shrink decides who scoots how much.
Higher flex-shrink value = shrinks more.
Lower value = shrinks less.
flex-shrink: 0 = ‚ùå don't shrink at all (even if there‚Äôs not enough space).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FLEX WRAP

if we use flex grow and we specified some min width it wipp go beyond the page at some point some element may get vanish , using flex wrrap wwe canwrap it to next line inse=tead of vanishing
apply felx wrap to the containerr of the elemment.
when an element wrapt o the next line it take up all the available spaces
wrap-reeverse make the elemrnt go abovvve instaed of going below

FLEX BASIS

flex-basis	Sets the starting size of the flex item
Default	auto (takes content size or width)
Works with	flex-grow, flex-shrink

--------------------------------------------------

flex: apply all three in  one property
 you want elements to start at a certain size, but also be flexible when screen size changes.

flex : grow shrink basis

-------------------------------------------------------------------

FLOW AND AXIS

flex-flow is a shorthand property that combines:
flex-direction ‚Üí Direction of the items (row or column)
flex-wrap ‚Üí Whether items should wrap to the next line
So instead of writing both separately, you can write them together in one line.
flex-flow: <flex-direction> <flex-wrap>;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

ALIGN ITEMS

align-items is a Flexbox property that controls how flex items are aligned vertically (cross-axis) inside the container.
justify content is sapplied in main axix ad align items is applied to the croess axix

------------------------------------------------------
border-sizing: Depending on the box-sizing value, the total size of the box may change when you add padding or border.
‚úÖ Two Common Values:
Value	What it means
content-box (default)	üì¶ width = only content size. Padding and border are added outside.
border-box	üì¶ width = content + padding + border (all included in total size).

/* The order property lets you change the position of flex items without changing the HTML structure. */
.onee{order: 2;}
.twoo{order: -1;}
.three{order: 4;}
.fourr{order: 3;}
